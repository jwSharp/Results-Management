              <h3>For NHA's Attending Results Management or Leadership Health Care Programs for the First Time</h3>
              <p>
                A 50% discount applies for all attending NHA's who have never attended a Results Management or Leadership Health Care program. This applies to
                any registration option of 4 hours or more. You must code the submitted registration form NHA50 on the Name line to qualify for the discount.
                (May not be combined with any other discount)
              </p>

              <h3>For NHA's who Have Previously Attended Results Management or Leadership Health Care Programs</h3>
              <p>
                A 50% discount applies for all NHA's who have previously attended any Results Management or Leadership Health Care program on the condition they
                register for 2 or more program days and register a non-NHA staff member at the same 50% discount for any 2-day (or greater) registration option.
                You must code all registrations NHA+ on the Name line to qualify for the discount option. (May not be combined with any other discount)
              </p>

              <h4>For Group Registrations</h4>
              <p>
                On two-day (or greater) registrations, a 15% discount/registrant applies for 3 or more registrations from the same organization if paid with a 
                single check and a 20% discount/registrant for 10 or more if paid with a single check. If 10 register, the 20% group discount permits 2 to attend 
                for free, i.e., 5 for the price of 4. Join the many organizations that hold their staff meetings during the conference because of the convenience of 
                having everyone already gathered there. (Group discounts may not be combined with any other discount)
              </p>

              <h4>For Referrals</h4>
              <p>
                You may take an 8% discount off any registration option for yourself for recommending a first-time attendee. Both registrations must be returned
                in the same envelope, although payment may be made by separate checks. You must code your registration form REF on the Name line to qualify for
                this discount. (May not be combined with any other discount)
              </p>

              <h4>For Early Registrations</h4>
              <p>
                A 5% discount applies for all registrations postmarked by the Early Registration Deadline that appears in the conference literature. You must
                code your registration form EAR on the Name line to qualify for this discount. (May not be combined with any other discount)
              </p>

              <h4>NOTE:</h4>
              <p>
                Only one of the discounts above may be used per individual, facility, organization, or company. If you need additional details,
